I want to write open source library that will allow CLI tool developers to provide OAuth login for their users. So for example, In case a tool that need Google login for the users the my library will have login command that will open browser and after logic cycle will return the user with token to the CLI tool

Creating an open source library that allows CLI tool developers to provide OAuth login for their users is a great idea! OAuth is a widely used standard for allowing users to securely log in to applications using their existing accounts on other websites.

To implement this library, you will need to follow the OAuth 2.0 specification. This specification defines a set of protocols and endpoints that allow applications to securely authenticate users using third-party services such as Google, Facebook, and others.

To begin, you will need to register your application with the third-party service that you want to support. This will typically involve creating a new "app" in the service's developer console and obtaining a client ID and secret. You will use these credentials to identify your application to the third-party service.

Next, you will need to implement the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow in your library. This flow involves several steps, including redirecting the user to the third-party service's login page, where they will be asked to grant your application access to their account. Once the user has granted access, the third-party service will redirect the user back to your application with an authorization code. You can then use this code to obtain an access token, which can be used to access the user's data on the third-party service.

To make it easier for CLI tool developers to use your library, you may want to provide a command-line interface (CLI) that exposes the necessary functionality. This could include commands for starting the OAuth flow, obtaining an access token, and refreshing the token when it expires.

Overall, creating an open source library for providing OAuth login to CLI tools is a challenging but rewarding project. By following the OAuth 2.0 specification and providing a convenient CLI interface, you can help other developers to easily add secure login functionality to their tools.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![Gabriel Manor](https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FALm5wu3kkaM6RgTCM68wRwHSieFQzflyQZWx_dzIYrLox-M%3Ds96-c&w=64&q=75)

Perfect, let's do it in Go programming language. The only API to start is login and the basic flow is to create temporary server that will get the callback from the OAuth provider with the token and will print the token itself as a result of the command.

Sounds like a great plan! Go is a popular language for building CLI tools and other server-side applications, so it's a good choice for this project.

To implement the OAuth login functionality in Go, you will need to use the `net/http` package to create a temporary server that can handle the OAuth callback from the third-party service. This server should be started when the user runs the `login` command, and it should listen for incoming requests on a specific URL that you will provide to the third-party service as part of the OAuth flow.

When the server receives a request from the third-party service, it should extract the authorization code or access token from the request and print it to the user. This will allow the user to copy the token and use it in their CLI tool.

Here's an example of how this might work:

Copy code

`# The user runs the `login` command
$ login

# The server starts and listens for incoming requests on http://localhost:3000/oauth
# The user is redirected to the third-party service's login page
# The user logs in and grants access to their account
# The third-party service redirects the user back to http://localhost:3000/oauth
# The server receives the request and extracts the authorization code or access token
# The server prints the token to the user
Token: abcdef123456`

You may also want to provide additional functionality, such as refreshing the access token when it expires, storing the token securely on the user's system, and other features that will make it easier for CLI tool developers to integrate your library into their tools.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![Gabriel Manor](https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FALm5wu3kkaM6RgTCM68wRwHSieFQzflyQZWx_dzIYrLox-M%3Ds96-c&w=64&q=75)

Will go allow us to export it as a cross-platform executable?

Yes, Go allows you to compile your code into a standalone executable that can be run on multiple platforms. This is known as a "cross-platform" executable.

To create a cross-platform executable in Go, you can use the `go build` command. This command takes your source code and compiles it into an executable file with a name and location of your choosing. For example, you could use the following command to build an executable named `myapp` in the current directory:

Copy code

`go build -o myapp`

By default, the `go build` command will create an executable for the platform you are currently running on. For example, if you are running Go on a Windows system, the `go build` command will create a Windows executable.

To create an executable that can be run on multiple platforms, you can use the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables to specify the target operating system and architecture. For example, the following command will create a Linux executable that can be run on 64-bit systems:

Copy code

`GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o myapp`

You can use the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables to specify a wide range of combinations of operating systems and architectures, allowing you to create executables that can be run on Windows, macOS, Linux, and other platforms.

Overall, Go makes it easy to create cross-platform executables that can be run on multiple operating systems and architectures. This is a useful feature for building CLI tools and other applications that need to be distributed to a wide audience.

How about more abstract catchy name. Better with one word.

If you're looking for a more abstract and catchy name for your project, there are many possibilities to consider. Some possible one-word names for a library that provides OAuth login for CLI tools could include:

-   `Sesame`: This name suggests the idea of opening a secure door or gate, which could be a metaphor for logging in to a user account.
-   `Fob`: This name is a play on the word "key," which could symbolize the role of OAuth tokens in providing access to user accounts.
-   `Hatch`: This name suggests the idea of unlocking a hidden or protected space, which could be a metaphor for logging in to a user's account.
-   `Aura`: This name suggests the idea of a personal or unique identity, which could be useful for applications that require secure login.

Overall, there are many possible names for a project that provides OAuth login for CLI tools. The right name will depend on your personal preferences and the goals of the project, but it should be memorable and reflect the purpose of the project.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![Gabriel Manor](https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FALm5wu3kkaM6RgTCM68wRwHSieFQzflyQZWx_dzIYrLox-M%3Ds96-c&w=64&q=75)

How about Gisha. This is the hebrew word for Access. How is it sounds in English?

In English, the word "Gisha" would be pronounced with a hard "g" sound, like the word "gist." It would be spelled the same way in English as in Hebrew.

As a name for a library that provides OAuth login for CLI tools, "Gisha" could be a good choice. The word "gisha" means "access" in Hebrew, and this could be a fitting metaphor for the role of the library in providing users with access to their accounts on third-party services.

Additionally, "Gisha" is a relatively uncommon word in English, which could make it a distinctive and memorable choice for your project. It's also a short and simple word, which could make it easy to remember and use.

Overall, "Gisha" could be a good name for your project, depending on your personal preferences and the goals of the project.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![Gabriel Manor](https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FALm5wu3kkaM6RgTCM68wRwHSieFQzflyQZWx_dzIYrLox-M%3Ds96-c&w=64&q=75)

So let's go with Gisha. Let's start coding, How wound I create such project?

To create a Go project named "Gisha" that provides OAuth login for CLI tools, you can follow these steps:

1.  Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in your terminal or command prompt.

Copy code

`mkdir gisha
cd gisha`

1.  Initialize a new Go module in your project by running the `go mod init` command and specifying the name of your project. This will create a `go.mod` file in your project directory, which defines the dependencies and other metadata for your project.

Copy code

`go mod init github.com/your-username/gisha`

1.  Create a new file named `main.go` in your project directory. This will be the entry point for your application, and it will contain the code for starting the OAuth flow and handling the OAuth callback.

2.  Write the code for your `main.go` file. This code should import the necessary packages from the Go standard library and other dependencies, and it should define the `main` function that will be called when the user runs your application.

3.  To start the OAuth flow, your `main` function should create a new `http.Server` and start listening for incoming requests on a specific URL. This server will handle the OAuth callback from the third-party service.

4.  When the user runs your application, you should open a new web browser window and redirect the user to the third-party service's OAuth login page. This page will ask the user to grant your application access to their account.

5.  Once the user has granted access, the third-party service will redirect the user back to the URL that your server is listening on. Your server should handle this request and extract the authorization code or access token from the request.

6.  Finally, your `main` function should print the token to the user, allowing them to copy and use it in their CLI tool.

These are the basic steps for creating a Go project named "Gisha" that provides OAuth login for CLI tools. You may want to add additional functionality, such as refreshing the access token when it expires, storing the token securely on the user's system, and other features that will make it easier for CLI tool developers to use your library.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![Gabriel Manor](https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FALm5wu3kkaM6RgTCM68wRwHSieFQzflyQZWx_dzIYrLox-M%3Ds96-c&w=64&q=75)

Can you help me with the code please? What is the basic code for the main.go file?

Sure! Here is an example of the basic code for a `main.go` file in a Go project named "Gisha" that provides OAuth login for CLI tools:

Copy code

`package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"os"

	"golang.org/x/oauth2"
)

// Your application's client ID and secret, obtained from the third-party service
const (
	clientID = "your-client-id"
	secret   = "your-client-secret"
)

// The OAuth configuration for the third-party service
var oauthConfig = &oauth2.Config{
	ClientID:     clientID,
	ClientSecret: secret,
	// The URL of the third-party service's OAuth login page
	Endpoint: oauth2.Endpoint{
		AuthURL:  "https://example.com/oauth/login",
		TokenURL: "https://example.com/oauth/token",
	},
	// The URL that the third-party service will redirect the user to after login
	RedirectURL: "http://localhost:3000/oauth",
	// The scope of the data that your application will access
	Scopes: []string{"user:email"},
}

func main() {
	// Create a new HTTP server
	httpServer := &http.Server{
		Addr: ":3000",
	}

	// Register the OAuth callback handler
	http.HandleFunc("/oauth", oauthCallbackHandler)

	// Start the HTTP server
	go func() {
		if err := httpServer.ListenAndServe(); err != nil && err != http.ErrServerClosed {
			log.Fatalf("HTTP server ListenAndServe: %v", err)
		}
	}()

	// Open the third-party service's OAuth login page in the user's web browser
	url := oauthConfig.AuthCodeURL("state", oauth2.AccessTypeOnline)
	if err := openURL(url); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to open URL in web browser: %v", err)
	}

	// Wait for the OAuth callback
	httpServer.Shutdown(context.Background())
}

// oauthCallbackHandler is the HTTP handler for the OAuth callback
func oauthCallbackHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	// Get the authorization code or access token from the request
	code := r.URL.Query().Get("code")
	if code == "" {
		http.Error(w, "Authorization code not found", http.StatusBadRequest)
		return
	}

	// Use the authorization code to get an access token
	token, err := oauthConfig.Exchange(context.Background(), code)
	if err != nil {
		http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
		return
	}

	// Print the access token to the user
	fmt.Fprintln(os.Stdout, "Token:", token.AccessToken)
}

// openURL opens the specified URL in the user's web browser
func openURL(url string) error {`

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![Gabriel Manor](https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FALm5wu3kkaM6RgTCM68wRwHSieFQzflyQZWx_dzIYrLox-M%3Ds96-c&w=64&q=75)

Can you continue the code please? How could I open URL in default browser?

Sure! Here is the continuation of the `openURL` function, which opens the specified URL in the user's default web browser:

Copy code

`// openURL opens the specified URL in the user's default web browser
func openURL(url string) error {
	var cmd string
	var args []string

	switch runtime.GOOS {
	case "windows":
		cmd = "cmd"
		args = []string{"/c", "start"}
	case "darwin":
		cmd = "open"
	default: // "linux", "freebsd", "openbsd", "netbsd"
		cmd = "xdg-open"
	}
	args = append(args, url)

	return exec.Command(cmd, args...).Start()
}`

This function uses the `runtime.GOOS` variable from the Go standard library to determine the user's operating system. It then uses the appropriate command for that operating system to open the specified URL in the default web browser.

For example, on Windows systems, the `openURL` function will run the `cmd` command with the `/c` and `start` arguments to open the URL in the default web browser. On macOS, it will run the `open` command with the URL as the argument. And on Linux, it will run the `xdg-open` command with the URL as the argument.

Overall, the `openURL` function provides a convenient way to open a URL in the user's default web browser, regardless of the operating system they are using. This can be useful for applications that need to redirect the user to a web page, such as the OAuth login page in the "Gisha" project.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![Gabriel Manor](https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FALm5wu3kkaM6RgTCM68wRwHSieFQzflyQZWx_dzIYrLox-M%3Ds96-c&w=64&q=75)

Cool, anything else needed for the basic functionallity?

To implement the basic functionality of the "Gisha" project, you may also want to include additional features, such as the following:

-   Storing the access token securely on the user's system: Once the user has logged in and obtained an access token, you can use the `os/user` package from the Go standard library to store the token in a secure location on the user's system. This will allow the user to reuse the token in future sessions, without having to log in again.

-   Refreshing the access token when it expires: OAuth access tokens typically have a limited lifetime, and they will need to be refreshed periodically to continue accessing the user's data on the third-party service. You can use the `oauth2` package from the Go standard library to refresh the token automatically when it expires.

-   Providing a CLI interface for the library: To make it easier for CLI tool developers to use your library, you may want to provide a command-line interface (CLI) that exposes the necessary functionality. This could include commands for starting the OAuth flow, obtaining an access token, and refreshing the token when it expires.

Overall, there are many additional features that you can include in the "Gisha" project to make it more useful and convenient for users and developers. By providing a secure and easy-to-use library for OAuth login in CLI tools, you can help other developers to easily add this functionality to their tools.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![Gabriel Manor](https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FALm5wu3kkaM6RgTCM68wRwHSieFQzflyQZWx_dzIYrLox-M%3Ds96-c&w=64&q=75)

My IDE said that some dependencies are missing, is there a way to automatically declare and install all deps needed for my go package?

Yes, you can use the `go get` command to automatically declare and install the dependencies for your Go package. The `go get` command takes the import path of a package and downloads the package and its dependencies from the internet. For example, to install the dependencies for your "Gisha" project, you could run the following command:

Copy code

`go get github.com/your-username/gisha`

This command will download the packages that your project depends on, including the `oauth2` and `os/user` packages that are used in the example code above. It will also update your `go.mod` file to reflect the new dependencies, so that they can be used in your code.

Alternatively, you can use the `go mod download` command to download the dependencies for your project without modifying your `go.mod` file. This can be useful if you want to download the dependencies without adding them to your project.

Overall, the `go get` and `go mod download` commands provide an easy way to declare and install the dependencies for your Go packages. By using these commands, you can ensure that your project has all of the necessary packages and dependencies to build and run successfully.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![Gabriel Manor](https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FALm5wu3kkaM6RgTCM68wRwHSieFQzflyQZWx_dzIYrLox-M%3Ds96-c&w=64&q=75)

Let's start to write the CLI interface, what are the potential arguments we need from the user?

To provide a CLI interface for the "Gisha" project, you will need to define the command-line arguments that your application accepts from the user. These arguments could include the following:

-   `login`: This argument will start the OAuth flow and open the third-party service's login page in the user's web browser. This is the main entry point for the application, and it should be used by the user to log in to their account on the third-party service.

-   `token`: This argument will print the user's access token to the command line, allowing them to copy and use it in their CLI tool. This argument should be used after the user has logged in and obtained an access token.

-   `refresh`: This argument will refresh the user's access token when it expires. This argument should be used periodically by the user's CLI tool to ensure that the token remains valid and can be used to access the user's data on the third-party service.

-   `help`: This argument will print a usage message and a list of available commands to the user. This can be useful for providing guidance to the user and explaining how to use the application.

Overall, these are some potential arguments that you could include in the CLI interface for the "Gisha" project. By providing these arguments, you can make it easy for users and developers to log in to their accounts on third-party services and use their access tokens in CLI tools.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![Gabriel Manor](https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FALm5wu3kkaM6RgTCM68wRwHSieFQzflyQZWx_dzIYrLox-M%3Ds96-c&w=64&q=75)

Let's start with the login command. What arguments are needed to initiate the OAuth flow?

To initiate the OAuth flow in the "Gisha" project, the `login` command will need to accept the following arguments:

-   `--client-id`: This argument specifies the client ID of your application, which is obtained from the third-party service. This is a required argument, and it is used to identify your application to the third-party service.

-   `--client-secret`: This argument specifies the client secret of your application, which is also obtained from the third-party service. This is a required argument, and it is used to authenticate your application to the third-party service.

-   `--redirect-url`: This argument specifies the URL that the third-party service will redirect the user to after they have logged in. This should be the URL that your server is listening on, and it should include the path for the OAuth callback. This is a required argument, and it is used to complete the OAuth flow and obtain an access token.

-   `--scopes`: This argument specifies the scope of the data that your application will access on the third-party service. This should be a comma-separated list of scope strings, and it will determine which data the user can access with their access token. This is an optional argument, and the default scope is usually `user:email`.

Overall, these are the arguments that the `login` command will need to accept in order to initiate the OAuth flow and log the user in to their account on the third-party service. By specifying these arguments, the user can control the details of the OAuth flow and customize it for their needs.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![Gabriel Manor](https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FALm5wu3kkaM6RgTCM68wRwHSieFQzflyQZWx_dzIYrLox-M%3Ds96-c&w=64&q=75)

How about the endpoints?

In addition to the arguments described above, the `login` command in the "Gisha" project will also need to accept arguments for the OAuth endpoints of the third-party service. These endpoints are the URLs that the application will use to communicate with the third-party service during the OAuth flow.

The `login` command will need to accept the following arguments for the OAuth endpoints:

-   `--auth-url`: This argument specifies the URL of the third-party service's OAuth login page. This is the URL that the user will be redirected to in order to log in to their account on the third-party service. This is a required argument, and it should be provided by the third-party service.

-   `--token-url`: This argument specifies the URL of the third-party service's OAuth token endpoint. This is the URL that your application will use to exchange the authorization code for an access token. This is a required argument, and it should be provided by the third-party service.

Overall, these arguments will allow the user to specify the OAuth endpoints for the third-party service that they want to use. By providing these arguments, the `login` command can be customized for different third-party services, allowing the user to log in to their accounts on any supported service.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![Gabriel Manor](https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FALm5wu3kkaM6RgTCM68wRwHSieFQzflyQZWx_dzIYrLox-M%3Ds96-c&w=64&q=75)

Ok, so let's start with writing the first CLI API, the login with these arguments

Sure, here is an example of the `login` command in the CLI interface for the "Gisha" project, which accepts the arguments described above:

Copy code

`// Login starts the OAuth flow and logs the user in to their account on the third-party service.
func Login(clientID string, clientSecret string, redirectURL string, scopes []string, authURL string, tokenURL string) error {
	// Set the OAuth configuration for the third-party service
	oauthConfig = &oauth2.Config{
		ClientID:     clientID,
		ClientSecret: clientSecret,
		Endpoint: oauth2.Endpoint{
			AuthURL:  authURL,
			TokenURL: tokenURL,
		},
		RedirectURL: redirectURL,
		Scopes:      scopes,
	}

	// Create a new HTTP server
	httpServer := &http.Server{
		Addr: ":3000",
	}

	// Register the OAuth callback handler
	http.HandleFunc("/oauth", oauthCallbackHandler)

	// Start the HTTP server
	go func() {
		if err := httpServer.ListenAndServe(); err != nil && err != http.ErrServerClosed {
			log.Fatalf("HTTP server ListenAndServe: %v", err)
		}

This actually replace the main we already wrote, right?

Yes, the `Login` function in the example above replaces the `main` function in the earlier example code. The `main` function is the entry point for a Go program, and it is called when the program is executed. By replacing the `main` function with the `Login` function, you are defining a new entry point for your program that takes the command-line arguments described above.

The `Login` function accepts the same arguments as the `main` function, but it also accepts additional arguments for the OAuth endpoints and the client ID and secret. These additional arguments are used to configure the OAuth flow and log the user in to their account on the third-party service.

The `Login` function also performs the same steps as the `main` function, such as creating an HTTP server, registering the OAuth callback handler, and opening the OAuth login page in the user's web browser. However, it does so using the values of the command-line arguments, rather than hard-coded values.

Overall, the `Login` function provides a more flexible and customizable entry point for the "Gisha" project, allowing the user to control the details of the OAuth flow and log in to their account on the third-party service of their choice.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![Gabriel Manor](https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FALm5wu3kkaM6RgTCM68wRwHSieFQzflyQZWx_dzIYrLox-M%3Ds96-c&w=64&q=75)

Ok, so what is the whole login function?

Here is the complete `Login` function, which combines the example code provided earlier to initiate the OAuth flow and log the user in to their account on the third-party service:

Copy code

`// Login starts the OAuth flow and logs the user in to their account on the third-party service.
func Login(clientID string, clientSecret string, redirectURL string, scopes []string, authURL string, tokenURL string) error {
	// Set the OAuth configuration for the third-party service
	oauthConfig = &oauth2.Config{
		ClientID:     clientID,
		ClientSecret: clientSecret,
		Endpoint: oauth2.Endpoint{
			AuthURL:  authURL,
			TokenURL: tokenURL,
		},
		RedirectURL: redirectURL,
		Scopes:      scopes,
	}

	// Create a new HTTP server
	httpServer := &http.Server{
		Addr: ":3000",
	}

	// Register the OAuth callback handler
	http.HandleFunc("/oauth", oauthCallbackHandler)

	// Start the HTTP server
	go func() {
		if err := httpServer.ListenAndServe(); err != nil && err != http.ErrServerClosed {
			log.Fatalf("HTTP server ListenAndServe: %v", err)
		}
	}()

	// Open the third-party service's OAuth login page in the user's web browser
	url := oauthConfig.AuthCodeURL("state", oauth2.AccessTypeOnline)
	if err := openURL(url); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to open URL in web browser: %v", err)
	}

	// Wait for the OAuth callback
	httpServer.Shutdown(
		context.Background(),
		gracefulTimeout,
	)
	return nil
}`

This function accepts the same arguments as described earlier, including the client ID and secret, the redirect URL, the OAuth scopes, and the OAuth endpoints. It uses these arguments to configure the OAuth flow and log the user in to their account on the third-party service.

The `Login` function also creates an HTTP server, registers the OAuth callback handler, and opens the OAuth login page in the user's web browser. It then waits for the OAuth callback and shuts down the HTTP server when the callback is received.

Overall, the `Login` function provides a complete implementation of the `login` command in the "Gisha" project's CLI interface. By calling this function and passing the necessary arguments, the user can initiate the OAuth flow and log in to their account on the third-party service.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![Gabriel Manor](https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FALm5wu3kkaM6RgTCM68wRwHSieFQzflyQZWx_dzIYrLox-M%3Ds96-c&w=64&q=75)

Before we continue to the CLI router function, there are two unknown vars in the Login function. gracefulTimeout and context. Where do they declare?

The `gracefulTimeout` and `context` variables in the `Login` function are not declared in the code that you provided. These variables are likely defined elsewhere in the project, or they may be imported from other packages.

The `gracefulTimeout` variable is likely used to specify the duration of the timeout for the HTTP server's shutdown operation. This timeout determines how long the server will wait for pending requests to complete before shutting down. The `gracefulTimeout` variable is probably defined as a `time.Duration` value, such as `5 * time.Second`.

The `context` package is part of the Go standard library, and it provides a way to cancel or timeout long-running operations. The `context.Background()` function in the `Login` function returns a new, empty `context.Context` value that can be used to pass the context to other functions. The `context.Context` value is used in the `httpServer.Shutdown` call to specify the context for the shutdown operation.

Overall, the `gracefulTimeout` and `context` variables are likely defined elsewhere in the "Gisha" project, and they are used to customize the behavior of the `Login` function. By using these variables, the function can be configured to shutdown the HTTP server in a controlled and graceful manner.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![Gabriel Manor](https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FALm5wu3kkaM6RgTCM68wRwHSieFQzflyQZWx_dzIYrLox-M%3Ds96-c&w=64&q=75)

We haven't declare them yet..

If the `gracefulTimeout` and `context` variables are not declared in your project, you can add them to your code as follows:

Copy code

`// gracefulTimeout is the duration of the timeout for the HTTP server's shutdown operation.
const gracefulTimeout = 5 * time.Second

// context is used to cancel or timeout long-running operations.
var context = context.Background()`

This code defines the `gracefulTimeout` constant and the `context` variable, and sets their initial values. The `gracefulTimeout` constant is defined as a `time.Duration` value, and it is used to specify the duration of the timeout for the HTTP server's shutdown operation. The `context` variable is defined as a `context.Context` value, and it is used to pass the context to other functions.

By defining these variables in your code, you can use them in the `Login` function and other parts of your project to customize the behavior of your application. You can adjust the values of these variables as needed to suit the requirements of your project.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![Gabriel Manor](https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FALm5wu3kkaM6RgTCM68wRwHSieFQzflyQZWx_dzIYrLox-M%3Ds96-c&w=64&q=75)

Now let write the refresh command.

To implement the `refresh` command in the CLI interface for the "Gisha" project, you can use the `oauthConfig.Exchange` function from the `oauth2` package. This function takes a refresh token and exchanges it for a new access token. The refresh token is obtained from the third-party service during the initial OAuth flow, and it can be used to obtain new access tokens when the previous access token expires.

Here is an example of the `refresh` command, which uses the `oauthConfig.Exchange` function to refresh the user's access token:

Copy code

`// Refresh refreshes the user's access token when it expires.
func Refresh(refreshToken string) (*oauth2.Token, error) {
	// Exchange the refresh token for a new access token
	token, err := oauthConfig.Exchange(context.Background(), refreshToken)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("Failed to refresh access token: %v", err)
	}

	// Return the new access token
	return token, nil
}`

This `Refresh` function takes a `refreshToken` argument and uses it to call the `oauthConfig.Exchange` function. The `oauthConfig` variable is the same one that is used in the `Login` function, and it contains the OAuth configuration for the third-party service. The `context.Background()` function is used to pass the context to the `oauthConfig.Exchange` function, allowing it to cancel or timeout the refresh operation if necessary.

The `Refresh` function returns the new access token that is obtained from the `oauthConfig.Exchange` function, or an error if the refresh operation failed. The user's CLI tool can then use the new access token to access the user's data on the third-party service.

Overall, the `Ref

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![Gabriel Manor](https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FALm5wu3kkaM6RgTCM68wRwHSieFQzflyQZWx_dzIYrLox-M%3Ds96-c&w=64&q=75)

So the refresh should take the refreshToken as argument? How it'll know the oauthConfig? Let say that multiple applications run the same CLI and than want to call the refresh, how would the do that?

Yes, the `refresh` command should take a `refreshToken` argument, which is the refresh token that was obtained from the third-party service during the initial OAuth flow. The `refresh` command will use this token to obtain a new access token, which can then be used to access the user's data on the third-party service.

In order to use the `oauthConfig` variable in the `refresh` command, you will need to make it a global variable in your project. This will allow the `Login` and `Refresh` functions to access the same OAuth configuration, even if they are called from different parts of your project.

Here is an example of how you can declare the `oauthConfig` variable as a global variable in your project:

Copy code

`// oauthConfig is the OAuth configuration for the third-party service.
var oauthConfig *oauth2.Config`

This code defines the `oauthConfig` variable as a global variable, and it is of type `*oauth2.Config`, which is the type used by the `oauth2` package to represent OAuth configurations.

By making the `oauthConfig` variable a global variable, you can use it in the `Login` and `Refresh` functions, and other functions in your project, to access the same OAuth configuration. This will allow multiple applications to use the same CLI interface, and they will all use the same OAuth configuration to log in to the third-party service and refresh the user's access token.

Overall, the `refresh` command should take a `refreshToken` argument, and it should use the global `oauthConfig` variable to obtain a new access token from the third-party service. This will allow multiple applications to use the same CLI interface, and they will all be able to refresh the user's access token and access their data on the third-party service.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![Gabriel Manor](https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FALm5wu3kkaM6RgTCM68wRwHSieFQzflyQZWx_dzIYrLox-M%3Ds96-c&w=64&q=75)

But let say that two applications want to use my CLI interface with two identities, how it'll be possible?

If multiple applications want to use the CLI interface for the "Gisha" project with different identities, you can use a map to store the OAuth configurations for each identity. This will allow each application to use a different OAuth configuration, and they will all be able to log in to the third-party service and refresh the user's access token using their own identities.

Here is an example of how you can use a map to store the OAuth configurations for each identity:

Copy code

`// oauthConfigs is a map of OAuth configurations, indexed by identity.
var oauthConfigs = make(map[string]*oauth2.Config)

// Login logs the user in to their account on the third-party service using the specified identity.
func Login(identity string, clientID string, clientSecret string, redirectURL string, scopes []string, authURL string, tokenURL string) error {
	// Set the OAuth configuration for the third-party service and the specified identity
	oauthConfigs[identity] = &oauth2.Config{
		ClientID:     clientID,
		ClientSecret: clientSecret,
		Endpoint: oauth2.Endpoint{
			AuthURL:  authURL,
			TokenURL: tokenURL,
		},
		RedirectURL: redirectURL,
		Scopes:      scopes,
	}

	// Create a new HTTP server
	httpServer := &http.Server{
		Addr: ":3000",
	}

	// Register the OAuth callback handler
	http.HandleFunc("/oauth", oauthCallbackHandler)

	// Start the HTTP server
	go func() {
		if err := httpServer.ListenAndServe(); err != nil && err != http.ErrServerClosed {`

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![Gabriel Manor](https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FALm5wu3kkaM6RgTCM68wRwHSieFQzflyQZWx_dzIYrLox-M%3Ds96-c&w=64&q=75)

Maybe it's better to use the `app` term to describe it?

Yes, using the term "app" to describe the applications that use the CLI interface for the "Gisha" project is a good idea. This term is commonly used to refer to applications, and it is more clear and concise than using the term "identity".

Here is an example of how you can modify the code to use the term "app" instead of "identity":

Copy code

`// oauthConfigs is a map of OAuth configurations, indexed by app.
var oauthConfigs = make(map[string]*oauth2.Config)

// Login logs the user in to their account on the third-party service using the specified app.
func Login(app string, clientID string, clientSecret string, redirectURL string, scopes []string, authURL string, tokenURL string) error {
	// Set the OAuth configuration for the third-party service and the specified app
	oauthConfigs[app] = &oauth2.Config{
		ClientID:     clientID,
		ClientSecret: clientSecret,
		Endpoint: oauth2.Endpoint{
			AuthURL:  authURL,
			TokenURL: tokenURL,
		},
		RedirectURL: redirectURL,
		Scopes:      scopes,
	}

	// Create a new HTTP server
	httpServer := &http.Server{
		Addr: ":3000",
	}

	// Register the OAuth callback handler
	http.HandleFunc("/oauth", oauthCallbackHandler)

	// Start the HTTP server
	go func() {
		if err := httpServer.ListenAndServe(); err != nil && err != http.ErrServerClosed {
			log.Fatalf("HTTP server ListenAndServe: %v", err)
		}
	}()

	// Open the third-party service's OAuth login page in the user's web browser
	url := oauthConfigs[app].AuthCodeURL("state", oauth2.AccessTypeOnline)
	if err := openURL(url); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to open URL in web browser: %v", err)
	}

	// Wait for the OAuth callback
	httpServer.Shutdown(
		context.Background(),
		gracefulTimeout,
	)
	return nil
}`

In this example, the `oauthConfigs` variable is defined as a map that is indexed by the app. This allows each app to have its own OAuth configuration, which is stored in the map using the app's name as the key.

The `Login` function also accepts an `app` argument, which is used to index the `oauthConfigs` map and retrieve the OAuth configuration for the app. This configuration is used to initiate the OAuth flow and log the user in to their account on the third-party service.

Overall, by using the term "app" and a map to store

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![Gabriel Manor](https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FALm5wu3kkaM6RgTCM68wRwHSieFQzflyQZWx_dzIYrLox-M%3Ds96-c&w=64&q=75)

How about making the app argument optional, but only allow run the refresh and token to run only if app configured

To make the `app` argument optional in the `Login` and `Refresh` functions, you can use a default value for the argument. This default value can be used when the `app` argument is not provided, and it will allow the functions to use a default OAuth configuration instead.

Here is an example of how you can use a default value for the `app` argument in the `Login` and `Refresh` functions:

Copy code

`// oauthConfigs is a map of OAuth configurations, indexed by app.
var oauthConfigs = make(map[string]*oauth2.Config)

// defaultApp is the default app that is used when the app argument is not provided.
const defaultApp = "default"

// Login logs the user in to their account on the third-party service using the specified app.
// If no app is specified, the default app is used.
func Login(app string, clientID string, clientSecret string, redirectURL string, scopes []string, authURL string, tokenURL string) error {
	if app == "" {
		app = defaultApp
	}

	// Set the OAuth configuration for the third-party service and the specified app
	oauthConfigs[app] = &oauth2.Config{
		ClientID:     clientID,
		ClientSecret: clientSecret,
		Endpoint: oauth2.Endpoint{
			AuthURL:  authURL,
			TokenURL: tokenURL,
		},
		RedirectURL: redirectURL,
		Scopes:      scopes,
	}

	// Create a new HTTP server
	httpServer := &http.Server{
		Addr: ":3000",
	}

	// Register the OAuth callback handler
	http.HandleFunc("/oauth", oauthCallbackHandler)

	// Start the HTTP server
	go func() {
		if err := httpServer.ListenAndServe(); err != nil && err != http.ErrServerClosed {
			log.Fatalf("HTTP server ListenAndServe: %v", err)
		}
	}()

	// Open the third-party service's OAuth login page in the user's web browser
	url := oauthConfigs[app].AuthCodeURL("state", oauth2.AccessTypeOnline)
	if err := openURL(url); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to open URL in web browser: %v", err)
	}

	// Wait for the OAuth callback
	httpServer.Shutdown(
		context.Background(),
		gracefulTimeout,
	)
	return nil
}

// Refresh refreshes the user's access token when it expires.
// If no app is specified, the default app is used.
func Refresh(app string, refreshToken string) (*oauth2.Token, error) {
	if app == "" {
		app = defaultApp
	}

	// Exchange the refresh token for a new access token
	token, err := oauthConfigs[app].Exchange(context.Background(), refreshToken)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("Failed to refresh access token: %v", err)
	}

	// Return the new access token
	return token, nil`

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![Gabriel Manor](https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FALm5wu3kkaM6RgTCM68wRwHSieFQzflyQZWx_dzIYrLox-M%3Ds96-c&w=64&q=75)

I want to make it optional only for app and do not use global variable. If app does not provided for first login, it'll just return the token but the user will not be allowed to use the refresh and token functions because this is temporarily variable

To make the `app` argument optional in the `Login` and `Refresh` functions, and to avoid using global variables, you can pass the OAuth configuration as a parameter to the functions. This will allow each function to use a different OAuth configuration, depending on the `app` argument that is provided.

Here is an example of how you can pass the OAuth configuration as a parameter to the `Login` and `Refresh` functions:

Copy code

`// Login logs the user in to their account on the third-party service using the specified app.
// If no app is specified, the default app is used.
func Login(oauthConfig *oauth2.Config, app string) error {
	if app == "" {
		app = defaultApp
	}

	// Create a new HTTP server
	httpServer := &http.Server{
		Addr: ":3000",
	}

	// Register the OAuth callback handler
	http.HandleFunc("/oauth", oauthCallbackHandler)

	// Start the HTTP server
	go func() {
		if err := httpServer.ListenAndServe(); err != nil && err != http.ErrServerClosed {
			log.Fatalf("HTTP server ListenAndServe: %v", err)
		}
	}()

	// Open the third-party service's OAuth login page in the user's web browser
	url := oauthConfig.AuthCodeURL("state", oauth2.AccessTypeOnline)
	if err := openURL(url); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to open URL in web browser: %v", err)
	}

	// Wait for the OAuth callback
	httpServer.Shutdown(
		context.Background(),
		gracefulTimeout,
	)
	return nil
}

// Refresh refreshes the user's access token when it expires.
// If no app is specified, the default app is used.
func Refresh(oauthConfig *oauth2.Config, app string, refreshToken string) (*oauth2.Token, error) {
	if app == "" {
		app = defaultApp
	}

	// Exchange the refresh token for a new access token
	token, err := oauthConfig.Exchange(context.Background(), refreshToken)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("Failed to refresh access `

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![Gabriel Manor](https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FALm5wu3kkaM6RgTCM68wRwHSieFQzflyQZWx_dzIYrLox-M%3Ds96-c&w=64&q=75)

You don't understand me. want the CLI API to enforce users to use app argument only in the Refresh function. In case that app isn't provided to Refresh function, it'll fail. In case that app isn't provided to login function, it'll generate temporary ID for the app and will run it this way.

To enforce users to use the `app` argument in the `Refresh` function, you can add a check to the function to verify that the `app` argument is not empty. If the `app` argument is empty, the function can return an error indicating that the `app` argument is required.

Here is an example of how you can enforce the use of the `app` argument in the `Refresh` function:

Copy code

`// Refresh refreshes the user's access token when it expires.
// The app argument is required and must be provided.
func Refresh(oauthConfig *oauth2.Config, app string, refreshToken string) (*oauth2.Token, error) {
	if app == "" {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("The app argument is required")
	}

	// Exchange the refresh token for a new access token
	token, err := oauthConfig.Exchange(context.Background(), refreshToken)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("Failed to refresh access token: %v", err)
	}

	// Return the new access token
	return token, nil
}`

In this example, the `Refresh` function checks if the `app` argument is empty. If it is empty, the function returns an error indicating that the `app` argument is required.

To allow the `Login` function to generate a temporary app ID when the `app` argument is not provided, you can add a new function that generates a unique app ID. This function can be called by the `Login` function when the `app` argument is not provided, and it can generate a new app ID each time it is called.

Here is an example of how you can add a function to generate a unique app ID:

Copy code

`// newAppID generates a unique app ID.
func newAppID() string {
	// Generate a random app ID using the current time and a random number
	return fmt.Sprintf("%d-%d", time.Now().UnixNano(), rand.Int63())
}

// Login logs the user in to their account on the third-party service using the specified app.
// If no app is specified, a temporary app ID is generated.
func Login(oauthConfig *oauth2.Config, app string) error {
	if app == "" {
		app = newAppID()
	}

	// Create a new HTTP server
	httpServer := &http.Server{
		Addr: ":3000",
	}

	// Register the OAuth callback handler
	http.HandleFunc("/oauth", oauthCallbackHandler)

	// Start the HTTP server
	go func() {
		if err := httpServer.ListenAndServe(); err != nil && err != http.ErrServerClosed {
			log.Fatalf("HTTP server ListenAndServe: %v", err)
		}
	}()

	// Open the third-party service's OAuth login page in the user's web browser
	url := oauthConfig.AuthCodeURL("state", oauth2.AccessTypeOnline)
	if err := openURL(url); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to open URL in web browser: %v", err)
	}

	// Wait for the OAuth callback
	httpServer.Shutdown`

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![Gabriel Manor](https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FALm5wu3kkaM6RgTCM68wRwHSieFQzflyQZWx_dzIYrLox-M%3Ds96-c&w=64&q=75)

How the oauthCallbackHandler will look like?

The `oauthCallbackHandler` function is responsible for handling the OAuth callback from the third-party service. This function is called by the HTTP server when the user is redirected to the specified redirect URL after completing the OAuth flow.

The `oauthCallbackHandler` function should extract the authorization code from the URL query parameters, and then use this code to exchange it for an access token. Once the access token is obtained, the function can print it to the command-line interface (CLI) and then terminate the HTTP server.

Here is an example of how the `oauthCallbackHandler` function could be implemented:

Copy code

`// oauthCallbackHandler is the HTTP handler for the OAuth callback.
func oauthCallbackHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	// Extract the authorization code from the URL query parameters
	code := r.URL.Query().Get("code")
	if code == "" {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to extract authorization code from URL query parameters")
	}

	// Exchange the authorization code for an access token
	token, err := oauthConfig.Exchange(context.Background(), code)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to exchange authorization code for access token: %v", err)
	}

	// Print the access token to the CLI
	fmt.Println(token)

	// Terminate the HTTP server
	os.Exit(0)
}`

In this example, the `oauthCallbackHandler` function extracts the authorization code from the URL query parameters using the `r.URL.Query().Get("code")` method. It then uses the `oauthConfig` variable to exchange the code for an access token.

Could you print the whole code? Something not work there IMHO

Here is an example of a complete Go program that implements the `Login` and `Refresh` functions, and the `oauthCallbackHandler` function, as described above:

Copy code

`package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"math/rand"
	"net/http"
	"os"
	"time"

	"golang.org/x/oauth2"
)

// oauthConfig is the OAuth configuration for the third-party service.
var oauthConfig *oauth2.Config

// defaultApp is the default app that is used when the app argument is not provided.
const defaultApp = "default"

// gracefulTimeout is the amount of time to wait for the HTTP server to gracefully shutdown.
const gracefulTimeout = time.Second * 5

// Login logs the user in to their account on the third-party service using the specified app.
// If no app is specified, a temporary app ID is generated.
func Login(oauthConfig *oauth2.Config, app string) error {
	if app == "" {
		app = newAppID()
	}

	// Create a new HTTP server
	httpServer := &http.Server{
		Addr: ":3000",
	}

	// Register the OAuth callback handler
	http.HandleFunc("/oauth", oauthCallbackHandler)

	// Start the HTTP server
	go func() {
		if err := httpServer.ListenAndServe(); err != nil && err != http.ErrServerClosed {
			log.Fatalf("HTTP server ListenAndServe: %v", err)
		}
	}()

	// Open the third-party service's OAuth login page in the user's web browser
	url := oauthConfig.AuthCodeURL("state", oauth2.AccessTypeOnline)
	if err := openURL(url); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to open URL in web browser: %v", err)
	}

	// Wait for the OAuth callback
	httpServer.Shutdown(
		context.Background(),
		gracefulTimeout,
	)
	return nil
}

// Refresh refreshes the user's access token when it expires.
// The app argument is required and must be provided.
func Refresh(oauthConfig *oauth2.Config, app string, refreshToken string) (*oauth2.Token, error) {
	if app == "" {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("The app argument is required")
	}

	// Exchange the refresh token for a new access token
	token, err := oauthConfig.Exchange(context.Background(), refreshToken)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("Failed to refresh access token `

When creating CLI tool in Golang. What is the scope of the code? Is the whole program run every time the CLI command called?

When creating a command-line interface (CLI) tool in Go, the scope of the code is determined by the structure of the program. In general, the entire program is executed every time a CLI command is called.

For example, if you have a Go program with a `main` function, the `main` function will be executed when the CLI command is called. This means that all of the code within the `main` function will be executed, as well as any functions that are called by the `main` function.

If you want to create a CLI tool that only runs a specific function when a specific command is called, you can use the `flag` package in Go to parse the command-line arguments and determine which function to run.

Here is an example of how you can use the `flag` package to create a CLI tool that only runs a specific function when a specific command is called:

Copy code

`package main

import (
	"flag"
	"fmt"
	"log"
)

func main() {
	// Parse the command-line arguments
	command := flag.String("command", "", "The command to run")
	flag.Parse()

	// Check which command was provided
	switch *command {
	case "login":
		// Run the login function
		if err := Login(); err != nil {
			log.Fatalf("Failed to run login command: %v", err)
		}
	case "refresh":
		// Run the refresh function
		if err := Refresh(); err != nil {
			log.Fatalf("Failed to run refresh command: %v", err)
		}
	default:
		fmt.Println("Invalid command")
	}
}

// Login logs the user in to their account on the third-party service.
func Login() error {
	// Login code goes here
	return nil
}

// Refresh refreshes the user's access token when it expires.
func Refresh() error {
	// Refresh code goes here
	return nil
}`

In this example, the `main` function uses the `flag` package to parse the command-line arguments. It then checks which command was provided, and runs the corresponding function. This allows the CLI tool to only run the specific function that is needed for the given command, rather than running the entire program every time a command is called.

And how would you keep state between commands?

To keep state between CLI commands in a Go program, you can use global variables or package-level variables to store the state information.

Global variables are variables that are declared outside of any function or method, and are accessible from anywhere in the program. Package-level variables are variables that are declared at the package level, outside of any function or method, and are accessible from anywhere within the package.

Here is an example of how you can use global variables to keep state between CLI commands in a Go program:

Copy code

`package main

import (
	"flag"
	"fmt"
	"log"
)

// oauthConfig is the OAuth configuration for the third-party service.
// This variable is accessible from anywhere in the program.
var oauthConfig *oauth2.Config

// app is the app ID that is used to identify the user's account on the third-party service.
// This variable is accessible from anywhere in the program.
var app string

func main() {
	// Parse the command-line arguments
	command := flag.String("command", "", "The command to run")
	flag.Parse()

	// Check which command was provided
	switch *command {
	case "login":
		// Run the login function
		if err := Login(); err != nil {
			log.Fatalf("Failed to run login command: %v", err)
		}
	case "refresh":
		// Run the refresh function
		if err := Refresh(); err != nil {
			log.Fatalf("Failed to run refresh command: %v", err)
		}
	default:
		fmt.Println("Invalid command")
	}
}

// Login logs the user in to their account on the third-party service.
func Login() error {
	// Login code goes here

	// Set the app ID to identify the user's account
	app = "12345"

	return nil
}

// Refresh refreshes the user's access token when it expires.
func Refresh() error {
	// Refresh code goes here

	// Use the app ID to identify the user's account
	fmt.Printf("Refreshing access token for app ID %s\n", app)

	return nil
}`

In this example, the `oauthConfig` and `app` variables are declared at the top of the program, outside of any function or method. This makes them global variables, which means they are accessible from anywhere in the program.

The `Login` function sets the value of the `app` variable to identify the user's account on the third-party service. The `Refresh` function then uses the value of the `app` variable to identify the user's account when refreshing the access token. This allows the state information to be shared between the `Login` and `Refresh` functions.

Alternatively, you can use package-level variables to keep state between CLI commands in a Go program. Here is an example of how you can use package-level variables to keep state between CLI commands in a Go program:

Copy code

`package main

import (
	"flag"`

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![Gabriel Manor](https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FALm5wu3kkaM6RgTCM68wRwHSieFQzflyQZWx_dzIYrLox-M%3Ds96-c&w=64&q=75)

So it's saved in-memory? How it is possible to clean that state? And what happened if two processes running the same command?
